### What is civil society

Civil society is any community united around an issue, common intertests and/or a joint activity. Civil society can be a formal organization or an unofficial community. 

### Why involve civil society

Collaboting with civil society has much added value when your research has a specific target audience outside of academia. For example, you might be researching something that is relevant for persons with disabilities, or a specific neighbourhood within a city. Not only can your research benefit from reaching out to the people who belong to these communities, but these same people might benefit immensely from your research results. Reaching out to individuals within these communities might be difficult if not impossible. Civil society (organisations) can be of great help is reaching out to these communities. They usually: 
- have access to the right audience,
- use channels of communication that are inclusive and targeted to a specific audience (associations of persons with speficic disabilities or neighbourhood chat in case of examples above),
- and use language that is inclusive and effective for this specific target audience.

If your research is intended to have an impact on the communities the civil society represents, such communities have an extra benefit of helping you spread the word and often have the capacity to support your activities.
